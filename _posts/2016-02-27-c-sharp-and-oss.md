#C# and Open Source Software development

I am starting a new job and the software stack used there is complete open source. So I wanted to dive in head first and try
to see if I could build a simple web service on my own before my first day using the tools I'll have come first day of school.

I plan on building a simple web service using Service Stack, set up a continuous build on Travis CI, and create a docker container 
that will pull the artifact from the build and deploy the service to the docker container.
